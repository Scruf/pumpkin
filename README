In order to complete this assignmnet I used serverless framework to create the endoint.
The handler is located in the show.py file
For database I went with MySQL server which is running in Docker container
For styling I used Pep8. Some of the urls were left unchanged and it will probablly trip the linter.
However the rest of the Pep8 concerns were addressed
For unit test simple tests were wrote using pytest
In order to run the application you will need to install requirements.txt using 
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
Than you would need to install Js dependencies using
    npm install
After the requirements are installed run the bash script runner.sh. It will start up the environment
It will take about 4 minutes to start due to the fact that mysql needs to start properly.
While its running youll see the output of the test pets being inserted.
Once its done you can test the endpoint
